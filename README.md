### 🧩 **Task Breakdown by Role:**

#### **Frontend Developer:**
- Style the login page to be visually appealing and responsive.
- Create a mockup page to show the game result history.

#### **Backend Developer:**
- Implement a simple API endpoint to save game results.
- Create a route to fetch the game result history (no need for complex authentication).

#### **Full Stack Developer:**
- Complete both the Frontend and Backend tasks.
- Integrate the API to display the game result history on a new page.

#### **Web3 Developer:**
